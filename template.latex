\textit{The following document is an attempt at providing a template for Software Paper in the Digital Humanities. It was inspired by the JOSS guidelines\footnote{https://joss.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/submitting.html\#what-should-my-paper-contain }}.

\section{Summary}

Small summary for the paper / software. Including a link to an open-source repo ?

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Context}
\label{context}
Project(s) using the software. Scholarly background. Development history (if not a new project). What needs does the software address?

\subsection{Purpose of the software}
Main goal and global functionality of the software. How does the software address the needs outlined in \ref{context}?

\subsection{Similar tools}

Are any tools in competition with this one? What does this tool offer that differentiates it?

\section{Novelty and important functionalities}

Discuss any new or significant features the software provides

\subsection{Functionality 1}

Pictures are always welcome.

\subsection{Functionality 2}

\section{Missing features and difficulties}

Area where the developer may express regrets. Areas for future development. User feedback. Did the development effort fail? Why? 

\section{Good practices}

Tests and what not ? Might only be a part of the reviewing though. Difficulties in testing the software might be mentioned here ?

\section{Development stacks, Licence and Recommendations}

Not a very verbose area, except for recommendations potentially ? Language, (main) libraries.

Recommendations is targeted at

\begin{itemize}
    \item How you should probably deploy the tool
    \item How you might learn the tool the easiest way
    \item Etc.
\end{itemize}

\section{Acknowledgments}

Minor Collaborators (beta-testers ? QA ?) that should be acknowledged but might not be writting the paper.

\section{Fundings}

Self-explanatory. Might expand onto long-term questions: until when is this tool funded, how does its future look like ?
